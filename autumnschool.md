title: Autumn School

---


**1-4 October 2019 at the University of Amsterdam**

This year the EPOS graduate school meeting will focus on deep learning in psychology.
In the first 3 days you will receive a theoretical background, and hands-on practical assignments in neural networks (more specifically, deep convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks).

Topics that will be covered, in both the lectures and the labs/practical assignments, are:
* general concepts in AI and neural networks
* training such networks with back-propagation
* deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN)
* how these networks can be trained
* how data-sets used for training influences performance
* how activity in artificial neural networks can be related to neural data, and
* how to relate the behavior of these networks to human behavior.

Following the Autumn School there will be a symposium with (international) experts in the field focussing on current developments in cognitive computational neuroscience and AI. For EPOS members, entrance to the symposium will be included in the programme of the Autumn School, and they are not required to register for the symposium separately. Other visitors can register for the symposium using the normal registration form. It's possible to sign up for the symposium after the 1st of September 2019.


### Costs

EPOS students can participate for free, other people can participate in the course after acceptance (see 'registration'). The registration fee for non-EPOS members is €250,- for the first three days and/or €50,- for the symposium (including coffee breaks, lunch and drinks at the end of the symposium). Lunch will be provided on all days.

Students will use Colab and Python for all assignments. Prior knowledge in Python is required, or should be obtained before starting the course via material that will be provided (also see 'resources').

### Registration

You can register for this course *before the 1st of September* using the link below:
